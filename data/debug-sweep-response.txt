    "description": "BIS Project Nexus is merging with mBridge CBDC interoperability to create a sovereign-backed, multi-CBDC settlement layer that directly bypasses the need for any bridge currency. If 10+ central banks route cross-border flows through sovereign rails by 2027, XRP's bridge utility thesis becomes structurally obsolete. Central banks will choose sovereign infrastructure over private token rails every time when both are available.",

Banks don't need XRP as a bridge when they can hold USDC and settle natively. RLUSD competes in this market but at $1.5B is dwarfed by USDC's $45B+. The bridge currency model loses to direct stablecoin-to-stablecoin settlement.",

    "description": "Zero verifiable ODL volume data with a Q3 2026 deadline is the single most dangerous signal in this dataset. If Ripple were achieving institutional-grade ODL volumes, they would publicize it. The data void likely indicates ODL volume is flat or declining, meaning the core utility mechanism underpinning the entire thesis may already be failing. This isn't a data gap — it's a negative signal masquerading as missing data.",

Daily net flow of $2.2M implies ~$550M/year accumulation pace, reaching only ~$1.6B by year-end, far below the $5B target.
