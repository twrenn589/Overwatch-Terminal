BTC ETF IBIT saw strong $289M inflow on Feb 26 reversing prior outflows, while ETH ETF ETHA recovered $30M after a -$46M loss, signaling mixed but improving institutional sentiment.",
  "thesis_pulse": "XRP ETF ecosystem continues positive accumulation with $332K daily net inflow and $5.2M weekly net inflow across 7 funds — small but consistently positive in an extreme fear environment. RLUSD grew to $1.58B (32% of $5B kill switch target), up from ~$1B baseline, tracking constructively. JGB 10Y eased slightly to 2.156% from 2.24% but remains firmly in CRITICAL territory above 2%. Two critical kill switches (ODL volume, PermissionedDEX adoption) still have zero data with deadlines approaching.",

Slight improvement from last score of 80 — JGB yield eased from 2.24% to 2.156% and F&G improved from 11 to 13, but the overall environment remains firmly stressed."
