RLUSD market cap at $1.56B is the strongest kill switch performer at 31% of target. Price has drifted from the Feb 25 bounce, suggesting the recovery was speculative rather than conviction-driven.

Specifically: ETF adoption rated CONFIRMED/HIGH when organic flows are $14M; infrastructure rated ACCELERATING/HIGH when on-chain shows ghost chain metrics; ODL rated NEEDS_DATA yet institutional_custody rated STRONG without ODL proving utility.

The sweep reveals three critical blind spots: ghost chain on-chain activity directly contradicts the ACCELERATING infrastructure thesis, ETF AUM is 98.8% seed capital masking absence of organic institutional demand, and CCTP v2 represents an untracked competitor that may structurally cap RLUSD growth. The compounding risk of triple data vacuum (ODL + on-chain + PermissionedDEX) means the utility thesis cannot be validated — and may be unfalsifiable by design. Macro conditions (F&G 13, BTC/ETH outflows, BOJ yield stress) compound timing risk. While no single finding triggers a full EXIT, the convergence of 2 DANGER kill switches, 4 WARNING kill switches, 3 critical blind spots, and hostile macro conditions warrants immediate partial de-risk. The thesis is not disproven, but it is currently unprovable, and the risk of holding full exposure to an unprovable thesis in an extreme fear environment is asymmetric to the downside.",
    "bear_pressure_score": 52,
    "score_delta": 19,
    "score_reasoning": "Previous score of 33 was set before the sweep exposed three critical blind spots (ghost chain, ETF seed capital illusion, CCTP v2 competition) and before two kill switches were upgraded to DANGER. The +19 increase reflects: (1) XRPL ghost chain evidence is new and directly contradicts a HIGH confidence thesis score (+6), (2) ETF organic flow analysis reframes the flagship adoption metric from bullish to concerning (+4), (3) ODL and PermissionedDEX both upgraded to DANGER with approaching deadlines (+4), (4) CCTP v2 competitive threat is new, untracked, and near-term (+3), (5) supply concentration risk newly identified (+2). Partially offset by: XRP ETF positive flow divergence is real (-1), regulatory environment has no negative signals (-1), and some macro stress may be cyclical rather than structural (net 0). Score of 52 reflects a thesis that has crossed from 'challenged but intact' to 'structurally questionable pending data that may never arrive.'",
    "commander_summary": "The sweep exposes a fundamental credibility gap: XRPL's on-chain activity shows a dormant chain (96 TPS, null DEX volume, 907 XRP in order book depth) while thesis scores rate infrastructure as ACCELERATING with HIGH confidence — this contradiction alone warrants immediate score correction and partial de-risk. Two kill switches are now at DANGER with zero data and 7-month deadlines, ETF AUM is 98.8% seed capital with negligible organic demand, and an untracked competitor (Circle CCTP v2) threatens to structurally cap RLUSD before it reaches scale. Tactical recommendation is REDUCE_EXPOSURE — maintain core position but de-risk 30-40% until at least one DANGER kill switch resolves to verifiable data."
