  "market_summary": "XRP at $1.43 with a strong +6.8% 24h bounce and $3.1B volume, recovering within an extreme fear environment (F&G: 11). BTC and ETH ETFs both saw net outflows on Feb 24 ($-117M IBIT, $-46M ETHA), while XRP ETFs posted a modest $2.2M net inflow — a notable divergence. Total XRP ETF AUM at $1.1B with 792M XRP locked (1.29% of supply).",
  "thesis_pulse": "XRP ETF flows are diverging positively from BTC/ETH ETFs, posting net inflows while both majors saw significant outflows on Feb 24. RLUSD at $1.56B (31% of kill switch target) continues steady growth. The extreme fear environment (F&G: 11, down from 8 previously reported) combined with USD/JPY at 155.88 and JGB 10Y at 2.24% keeps macro stress firmly in critical territory. PermissionedDEX went live five days ago — institutional adoption data from this amendment remains the key near-term catalyst to monitor.",

Brent at $69.77 remains below the $85 elevated threshold, providing the only relief valve in the stress matrix."

The JGB yield crisis at 2.24% simultaneously threatens macro stability and validates the Japan adoption thesis — SBI's XRPL integration deepens as traditional infrastructure fractures.

BIS Project Nexus remains the most credible structural alternative that could render XRPL's bridge currency function obsolete at the sovereign level. The XRP ETF flow divergence is real but tiny ($2.2M against $1.1B AUM), and one day of positive flow does not establish a trend against the backdrop of $117M+ outflows from the crypto market's anchor product."
