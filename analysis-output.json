  "thesis_pulse": "XRP's 8% intraday bounce and positive ETF divergence (+$2.2M vs BTC/ETH outflows) is noteworthy but occurs on extreme fear (F&G: 11) which historically precedes either capitulation or reversal — not a trend confirmation. RLUSD at $1.57B is up from the ~$1B noted in thesis context, now at 31% of the $5B kill switch target with ~7 months remaining. XRP ETF AUM at $1.10B (22% of $5B target) needs to roughly 5x in 10 months — a steep but not impossible trajectory if macro stabilizes. Standard Chartered reportedly slashing XRP price targets is a negative institutional signal that warrants monitoring for broader sentiment contagion.",

The thesis requires utility growth that is not occurring, in a macro environment where capital is exiting crypto, with competing solutions that are already at scale. Two critical kill switches are in danger status with no path to resolution visible. The +8% price bounce and positive ETF flow divergence are insufficient to offset structural thesis degradation.

Score stays below 60 because: regulatory environment remains favorable, ETF structure exists and has positive flows, RLUSD is growing (if slowly), and no kill switch has formally triggered yet. The thesis is not dead but is materially weaker than previously scored.",
    "commander_summary": "The XRPL network is processing 159 transactions per ledger with $2,473 in order book depth — this is not institutional settlement infrastructure, it is an empty highway, and this single data point does more damage to the thesis than any competitor announcement. Compounding this, ODL volume remains unverifiable with 7 months to deadline, while JPMorgan Kinexys alone processes $2B+/day on proprietary rails that don't need XRP. REDUCE EXPOSURE: the thesis requires utility growth that on-chain data proves is not happening, in a market where three competing infrastructure categories are already at scale."
