  "thesis_pulse": "RLUSD market cap at $1.495B, slight decline from the $1.564B reference but still within tracking range — 30% toward the $5B kill switch target with ~10 months remaining. Fear & Greed at 11 signals capitulation-grade sentiment, which historically precedes either violent reversal or extended drawdown. XRP price at $1.34 puts it firmly in the bear-case price range (<$1 EOY bear threshold is only 25% below current). The institutional infrastructure thesis remains structurally intact — PermissionedDEX live, ETFs operational, Ripple Prime positioning continues — but the market is not rewarding any of it. The gap between institutional buildout narrative and on-chain activity / price action is widening to uncomfortable levels.",

USD/JPY at 155.98 is approaching but has not breached the 157 elevated trigger. Brent at $71.90 remains well below stress thresholds. The compound stress is driven by JGB yield trajectory plus extreme market fear (F&G 11), not by energy. However, the pre-loaded nature of Japan's fiscal position means the JGB move from 2.13% to 2.24% in one day is significant — this is approaching the refinancing band where Morningstar projects interest servicing jumps to 20-25% of expenditure."

(3) Fear & Greed kill switch has triggered at 11, compounding with speculative-dominated volume that has no utilitarian floor. The thesis scores show CONFIRMED/HIGH confidence across vectors that have zero operational verification — this is not conviction, it is blindness. Two kill switches are in danger status, one is triggered, and the bias ratio is 2.5:1 bearish. Position reduction is warranted until ODL volume data becomes verifiable and at least one competing infrastructure kill switch stabilizes.",

Score moves from 50 to 72 — firmly in elevated threat territory. The compounding of competing infrastructure across all three institutional settlement lanes (banks, central banks, fintechs) is the primary driver. This is not recoverable by a single positive catalyst.",

Fear & Greed has triggered at 11, the bias ratio is 2.5:1 bearish against thesis scoring that still reads CONFIRMED/HIGH, and the system has seven critical blind spots it wasn't tracking. REDUCE EXPOSURE — hold only what you can justify with verifiable data, which right now is very little."
